      is over all aggressive. She will alsos throw glitter at you... and it STAYS in your hair.
    </li></ul> 

    <li>Unfunny Dad Jokes</li>
    <ul><li>No, just no. The king specifically asked us to get her. The jokes arent funny and he's upset.</li></ul>

    <li>Pushed Winny the Pooh</li>
    <ul><li>This one is extreme. I happen to be cousins of Pooh and he came home crying saying she pushed him. Tigger was there and Piglet too.
      Everyone was scared and he was havinga n anxoiety attack. Pooh is a natioal treasure, so this will probably get her teh death penalty.

  <h4>Police Statement</h4>

 <p> <strong>This is a direct quote from the head of teh police department. He has this to say:</strong>
    <blockquote> "We are working harder than you guys think. These cirmials have taken and taken
    but they will no longer be abel to that. We have some of our most okay, some what decent officers on this job.
    We have <strong>John Doe</strong>, yes this his real name...we think. He is an okay officers, he is half blind buthe works harder 
    thank anyone else on the team. Then, we have <strong>Karl Smith</strong>. A warrior from Japan, Karl Smith. He- oh...im getting
    word that he isnt actually from Japan, but just likes something called Noroto. He might notbe an actual ninja
    but he has the heart of one. He has landed himself in the hospitla 12 times this month! If that isnt proof of
    how hard working he is, nothing is. Then, there's <strong>Junior Tuffnut</strong>. The roughest toughest officers thats ever been. He can throw a blade 100 feet on a bad day and 
    2 meters on a good day.  His desire to fight is stronger than all of us togetehr. He's put 30 of our officers in teh ICU this year alone, and its only February.
    Last, but surely not least, we have <strong>Lisa Joe</strong> working on this case. She might be the loudest person iver ever meet, and teh most annoying, but my wife has killed
    7 people... or 17 i cnat really remember but shes an okay person 30% of the time. With these four men working togethere to catch these criminals im sure at least
    one will be caught, eventually. There is no reason to fear, with T.I.T on teh case, the Talented Incompentent Troops. If you have any questions you can reach us on 
    Instagram at <em>t_IT69</em> . Our itern will write us a letter with your problems or concerns."
