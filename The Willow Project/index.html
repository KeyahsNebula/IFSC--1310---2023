  <h1>Crimes Committed</h1>

  <section>
  <ol>
    <li>Tax Evasion</li>
    <ul><li>This criminal has not paid her taxes since the day she was born. She has bitten police officers 
      who have come to try and talk to her and is just
      overall aggressive. Another thing to note is that she <strong>will</strong> also throw glitter at you... and it <strong> will </strong>stay 
      in your hair for at least 37 hours.
    </li></ul> 

    <li>Unfunny Dad Jokes</li>
    <ul><li>No, just no. The king specifically asked us to get her. The jokes arent funny and he's upset.</li></ul>

    <li>Pushed Winny the Pooh</li>
    <ul><li>This one is <em>extreme</em>. I happen to be a cousin of Pooh and he came home crying saying she pushed him. 
      Tigger was there and Piglet too. A total of three eyewitnesses.
      Everyone was scared, and Pooh was having an anxiety attack. Pooh is a national treasure of this kingdom, 
      so this will probably get her the death penalty.
    </li></ul>

    <li>Stole Millions</li>
    <ul><li>She robbed the king, She robbed Batman (yes Bruce Wane),
      She robber Peter Rabbit, she robbed Mickey Mouse, she robbed Mojo Jojo, and she even robbed Tweety Bird. She hasnt stopped either, her tedious Crimes
    continue to plauge the Kingdom of Valla.</li></ul>

  <h4>Police Statement</h4>

 <p> <strong>This is a direct quote from the head of the police department. He has this to say:</strong>
  <blockquote> "We are working harder than you guys think. These criminals have taken and taken
  but they will no longer be able to do that. We have some of our most okay, somewhat decent officers on this job.
  We have <strong>John Doe</strong>, yes this is his real name...we think. He is an okay officer, he is half-blind but he works harder 
  than anyone else on the team. Then, we have <strong>Karl Smith</strong>. A warrior from Japan, Karl Smith. He- oh... I'm getting
  word that he isn't actually from Japan, but just likes something called Noroto. He might not be an actual ninja
  but he has the heart of one. He has landed himself in the hospital 12 times this month! If that isn't proof of
  how hardworking he is, nothing is. Then, there's <strong>Junior Tuffnut</strong>. The roughest toughest officers that's ever been. He can throw a blade 100 feet on a bad day and 
  2 meters on a good day.  His desire to fight is stronger than all of us together. He's put 30 of our officers in the ICU this year alone, and it's only February.
  Last, but surely not least, we have <strong>Lisa Joe</strong> working on this case. She might be the loudest person I have ever met, and the most annoying, but my wife has killed
  7 people... or 70 I can't remember but she's an okay person 30% of the time. With these four men working together to catch these criminals I'm sure at least
  one will be caught, eventually. There is no reason to fear, with T.I.T. on the case, the Talented Incompentent Troops. If you have any questions you can reach us on 
  Instagram at <em>t_IT69</em> . Our intern will write us a letter with your problems or concerns."
