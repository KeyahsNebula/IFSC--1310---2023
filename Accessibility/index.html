    <h1>Accessibility</h1>
    <p>The word accessibility is not just a term used for individuals with disabilities. 
        It is used to describe anyone who is able to perform a given task. 
        According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary the word accessible means “capable of being reached” or “ being within reach”. 
        Therefore, whenever I think of what accessibility means to me I think of opportunities, inclusivity, and remembrance.
         No one should be limited to what they can do, because someone forgot to make their platforms accessible, especially programmers.</p>

        <p>Those who are labeled as disabled are not able to perform certain tasks without additional resources. 
        Just being able to read what I have written is an example of you having accessibility. 
        Although, certain problems can occur when we don't all have the same playing field. 
        If someone else wanted to read this but they were blind how would they? 
        That is where accessibility comes in. 
        Things like Screen readers will simply read the text to the desired user ( you don't have to be blind to use this feature), that is as long as the given code used to create the site is done in a way that allows the screen reader to read everything presented. 
        There are various ways that accessibility can be given out, as long as inclusivity is remembered. </p>

        <p>Whenever I think of accessibility the first thing that comes to mind is inclusivity. 
            Being included. Whenever everyone is taken into consideration and their needs are met, that is what accessibility is. 
            Since taking Web Technologies I have learned to think more about accessibility through the eyes of a programmer. 
            I now think of websites that have accessibility and those that do not. When I am writing code I now think of how to make sure that everyone can use it. 
            Making sure that the code is able to be utilized for everyone no matter what. 
            I try to keep my code usable to all and be as inclusive as I can. 
            I try to keep everything organized and understandable as I can because inclusivity is accessibility, and both are extremely important.</p>

            <p> There is much importance in making these accessible. 
                It is important because if no one can use your website then the site will fail. 
                If there are limitations on who can use the website and data that you have presented then that limits the number of people that can access and use the website, thus lowering profits and views.
                 If you are making a website for a customer and they need a website for their business, you will need to have the website accessible to everyone or else they will lose business and customers. 
                 Not only in businesses but in everyday life as well. If there is a website or anything else that the majority of the population is using, it is important to have it so that others can utilize it as well so they don't feel left out. 
                 Just because some people are not born with the same capabilities as others does not mean they should not be able to enjoy the same things as them.
        
        <p> Accessibility is not just about being disabled, it's about equal opportunities for everyone. 
            That's why when creating anything it is important to remember those with different needs and to include them.  
            Accessibility is important in a variety of ways.  </p>
